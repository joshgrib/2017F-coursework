## Intro
* Statisticians fine scientific problem solutions through data crunching
* Different amounts of data require different statistical models
>**TODO: Install R and Rstudio**

* Branches of statistics
    * Descriptive stats on the data
    * Inferential stats on the information the data represents
        * AKA "Mathematical stats", "probability stats"
* Course focus: ideas, methods, and computation using R
* *ANOVA* - Analysis of variance
* Different models come with different assumptions, which you're responsible for abiding by or else the results won't make sense
* Homework is for practicing statistical methods
    * Done in R, output as PDF, use online references for help

## Measures of location

### **Mean**
The arithmetical average of data, sensitive to outliers
\[\overline{x} = \frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i}\]
### **Order statistic**
The increasing arrangement of data
\[x_{1,n} \leq x_{2,n} \leq x_{3,n} \leq ... \leq x_{n,n}\]
### **Median**
The geometric middle point of data, not sensitive to outliers
\[\frac{x_{(n+1)}}{2,n} \forall odd(n)\]
\[\frac{x_{\frac{n}{2,n}} + x_{\frac{n}{2}+1,n}}{2} \forall even(n)\]

## Probability distribution function
\[F(x)=P(X \leq x)\]
tells the probability that
\[(X\leq x) \forall x\]

## Quartile function
\[F^{-1}(p)\]
defines a point x s.t.
\[F(x)=P(X \leq x) \leq p \land P(X \gt x) \gt (1-p) \land p \in (0,1)\]

### Percentiles / quartiles
* pth percentile for a sample - p% of observations are at or below this value
* quartiles divide the sample into 4 parts of equal percentages (25%, 50%, 75%)
    * Inter-quartile range(IQR)
    \[Q_3 - Q_1\]
    * summary(x) in R gives (minimum, Q1, median(Q2), Q3, maximum)
    * boxplots show (min, Q1, Q2, Q3, max), the "box" part shows the IQR
        * boxplot(x) in R

## Measures of spread

### Sample variance
\[s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_i - \overline{x})^2}\]
The average squared distince from the mean

Squaring accounts for positive and negative values so they don't cancel out

### Standard deviation
\[s = \sqrt{s^2}\]

Larger s = large variation
