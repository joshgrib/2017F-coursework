## Measures of association - correlation coefficient

* A **linear association** is common, and can be modeled with a linear regression
\[\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^{n}_{i=1}(\frac{x_i-\overline{x}}{s_x})(\frac{y_i-\overline{y}}{s_y})\]
This measures the *strength* and *direction* of a linear relationship between vectors \(x\) and \(y\), where \(s_x\) and \(s_y\)
 are standard deviations of \(x\) and \(y\) respectively

 ## Correlation coefficient - interpretation

 Let \(x = (x_1 - \overline{x}, ..., x_n - \overline{x})^T\) and \(y= (y_1 - \overline{y}, ..., y_n - \overline{y})^T\). Then,

 \[r=\frac{x^T y}{\sqrt{x^T x} * \sqrt{y^T y}}\]


# Sampling distributions

## Population and sample
* A population is the collection of all individuals under investigation (denoted by \(X\),\(Y\) etc.), and a sample consists of some observations \(X_1\), · · · , \(X_n\) of the population(denoted their realizations by \(x_1\), · · · , \(x_n\))
* **Population distribution**: values and probability of a population’s members. Usually unknown or partially unknown, thereby to be understood through a sample.
* **Sampling distribution**: values and probability for all members of the sample, which are observable.
* **Statistic:** a function of the sample, usually summarizing one aspect of the sample, its distributions is based on the sampling distribution.

## Binomial distribution
* For a number of observations, all independent of each other, where each observation can be categorized as a success of failure
* P(Success) = P(S) = p: the information on the population of interest

## Normal distribution
* The classic bell curve, shows population density


## Sample mean, sample variance, and Central Limit Theorem

## Sample proportion, Laplace theorem

## \({\chi}^2\) disribution, Student's \(t\) distribution, and Snedecor's \(F\) distribution
