## Intro to IT Security

**Data & computational outsourcing**
Cloud services are becoming more popular for storage, computation, databases, etc.
This comes with cost savings and benefits from economies of scale.
Used by both organizations and individuals.
Across different models and platforms - client-server, distributed, peer-to-peer, etc.

**Security consequences**
* information processed outside of one administrator control or "trust perimeter"
    * Can be intercepted and viewed or modified
    * Service storing the data can be compromised

**Advanced attacks**
* The stereotype of the lone hacker in a basement is totally wrong. Usually these attacks are carried out by teams of educated individuals, with advanced systems and planning

**Examples of threats**
* Eavesdropping - someones sees info not meant for them
* Alteration - someone intercepted and changes the data before passing it on
* Software bugs - code doesn't do what it is intended to do, this can create vulnerabilities in the system that can allow attackers to gain further access
* Denial of service - interruption of degradation of a system

**The "vulnerability, threat, control" paradigm"**
* We use security *controls* to protect against *threats* that seek to exploit possible *vulnerabilities*

**The CIA triad**: confidentiality, integrity, availability

**Controls and effects**(in order of effectiveness)
* prevent - attack is blocked
* deter - attack is harder
* deflect - change target of attack
* mitigate - make impact less severe
* contain - do not allow propagation
* detect - know about the attack real-time or afterwards
* recover - recover from effects of attack
