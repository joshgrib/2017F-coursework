**Announcements**
* Canvas site is now up
* lecture notes will be posted on canvas Tuesday morning and potentially revised later
    * Notes will not necessarily be exactly what we do in class
* Labs start this week
    * Lab is like a quiz, available before the lab, but the grade is just for attendance

# Intro
* The 'IT Security' game
    * It's more of an art than a science, there's not usually a clear answer to an issue, and different responses come with different drawbacks
* Examples of threats
    * Eavesdropping
    * Man-in-the-middle
    * Masquerading - fabrication of information
    * Repudiation - destroying information logging actions
    * Software bugs
* Main security properties - CIA triad
    * **Confidentiality** - information availability properly following access controls
    * **Integrity** - precise and accurate information, only intended actions available
    * **Availability** - usable and meeting the needs of the service

## Authenticity
* Ability to determine that access is genuine and valid
* Primary tool is digital signatures - cryptographic computations that allow someone to commit to the authenticity of their documents in a unique way
    * Achieves non-repudiation - access and actions cannot be denies by the user

## Anonymity
* The property that certain records/transactions cannot be attributed to any individual
* Some tools:
    * Aggregation - show statistics on a population
    * Proxies - pass through a trusted source
    * Pseudonyms - fake names
        * This can also potentially identify individuals but only to a trusted entity

## An unfair game
* Many threats, with a lot of different things to consider and protect against
* Risk management
    * You have to choose what to control and what to protect in what ways
    * "Choose your battle"
    * Analysis required for trade-offs, priorities, and residual risk

## Deciding on security controls
* Spending is based on effects and liklihoods, but both are impossible to measure perfectly
* An attack needs *method, opportunity, and motive*, without any the attack will fail

# Symmetric-key Crypto
* Etymology: crypto-graphy = secret-writing
* AKA "Secret-key encryption"
* Main applications are for military and government
* Older: the art of writing and solving codes
* Modern: a science of mathematical techniques for securing information

## Modern crypto
* Formal treatment: fundamental notions underlying the design and evaluation of crypto primitives
* Systematic process
    * Security goals - what is the definition of secure?
        * Abstracted as definitions
    * Threat model - what is the form of the attack?
        * Abstracted as settings
    * Security analysis - why is something actually secure or not?
        * Abstracted as proofs

## Setting of symmetric-key encryption
* Secret communication amongst two parties
* Alice **encrypts** her message to create a **ciphertext** to send instead of the **plaintext**
* Bob **decrypts** the ciphertext to get the plaintext
* A **secret key** is shared and used by both message transformations
    * We need the keys so the encryption and decryption algorithms can be public

>**Kerckhoff's priciple:** "The cipher method must not be required to be secret, and it must be able to fall into the hands of the enemy without inconvenience"
> This is important because otherwise you need new encryption and decryption algorithms for every pair of users. It's easier to change a short key than to get a whole new algorithm

## Main application areas
* Secure communication - between two parties
* Secure storage - accessed by one party

## Brute force attack
* Generic attack
    * Given a ciphertext, decryption algorithm and known key space
    * Guess possible keys in the key space until you decrypt the message
    * Known as an *exhaustive search*
* Counter measure
    * Key should be a **random value** from a **sufficiently large key space** to make exhaustive search attacks infeasible

## Attempt 1: Protect the key
* Security means that the adversary should not be able to compute the key
* Intuition: if the key isn't protected than anyone could easily decrypt
* Problem: this definition fails to exclude insecure schemes where the key has no effect on the encryption

## Attempt 2: Don't learn m
* Security means that the adversary should not be able to compute the message
* Intuition: if the message is learned then we fail
* Problem: this definition fails to exclude bad schemes where some or most of the message can be revealed

## Attempt 3: learn nothing
* Security means that the adversary should not be able to learn any information about the message
* Intuition: we don't want the attacker to be able to figure out the message
* Problem: the attacker might already know something, like the distribution of the message space

## Attempt 4: learn nothing new
* Security means that the adversary should not be able to learn any additional information about the message
* This means that the ciphertext doesn't help the attacker learn about the message or the key
    * Knowledge of the key has no effect on the probability of messages in the message space

## The One-time Pad
* A type of substitution that is absolutely unbreakable
* Encryption done by using a block of shift keys, where each one is chosen at random, applying each shift key to each bit in the message, doing a bitwise XOR of the message and the key, which are of equal lengths
    * Decryption is the same, XOR the ciphertext with the key to get the plaintext message
        * m &#8853; k = c
        * c &#8853; k = m
