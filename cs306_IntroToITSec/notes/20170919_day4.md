**This week**
* Lab 3 is a programming in Java thing, not another quiz
* Lab 3 will still have a quiz posted just for practice
* Homework 1 posted Friday

**Review**
* Since *perfect security* isn't really practical, we have *computational security* which ensures security in all realistic scenarios and is more functional

## Negligible functions
* Used to capture very small likelihoods
* Must have 1/(polynomial) probability of success for all inputs
* Small enough chance of success to not have to worry about it

## Game based definition of computational EAV-security
* EAV = eavesdropping attack, CPA = chosen plaintext attack
* We say an encryption scheme is **EAV-secure** if the best probability of guessing is 0.5 plus a negligible function

## CPA Security
* Anything CPA secure is also CPA secure for multiple encryptions
* CPA security requires probabilistic encryption (same input has different outputs)

# Pseudo-Random Generators (PRGs)
* Randomness is important for encryption so there aren't patterns that attackers can exploit
* True randomness isn't really possible with computers because they're extremely systematic
    * We need an efficient computation to generate things that appear to be random

## Linear congruential generator
* Given a seed value and some parameters we can make random looking stuff by applying the same function to each element
* Fast, but insecure because cycles through modulus create patterns
* Considered random if no efficient statistical analysis can tell the difference between true randomness and the generated pseudo-randomness, with more than a negligible chance of success over guessing

## Stream cipher modes of operation
* Synchronized mode - where a big random stream is generated from a key and sections of it are used for encrypting sections of the message
    * No indexes needed, EAV-secure
* Unsynchronized mode - where a key and an initialization vector are provided to create a pseudo-random stream for each section of a message, with a new random initialization vector sent with each section
    * allows the message to be divided and encrypted/decrypted faster, CPA-secure because of the random numbers provided with each section of the message

# Pseudo-random Functions (PRFs)
* A generalization of the PRG, producing pseudo-random bits that depend on a specific input
* This is a **block cipher** where the input and output have the same length
* Considered random if the output is selected randomly from the set of all possible messages of the given length
* A scheme that uses a random string as input to the PRF and uses the result for a one-time pad is CPA-secure as long as the PRF is secure

## Block cipher modes of operation
* **ECB** - Electronic Code Book
    * Insecure, only cool history
    * Deterministic so it's not CPA-secure, and actually isn't even EAV_secure
* **CBC** - Cipher Block Chaining
    * Given initial vector and use it for each block
* **Chained CBC** uses the ciphertext of the previous block as the initial vector for the next block
* **OFB** - output feedback
    * Use initial vector to generate the string to XOR with blocks of the message, using the previous result as the input of the next one
>**Note:** Block length matters, and initial vectors can be easily misused
