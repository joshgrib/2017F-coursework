## Main topics
* Computer system architecture
* Parallel computing
* Advanced computer organization
* Assembly language

> Idea: for course scheduling using a graph language might make it way easier, at least for determining prereqs
> Add courses as nodes, add conflicts as edges, search based on where there's no conflicts. Setting up the database might take a bit of processing but then the queries will be fast

## Stuff to get:
* *Need to buy an Arduino* - see if I can find my old one, or if it's at home somewhere. Some time **in the next month**
* *AVR Studio* - software for running assembly and getting some visuals. **Needs windows**, so set up a VM
* *Arduino GUI* - available for Linux

* Tuesdays - presentations
