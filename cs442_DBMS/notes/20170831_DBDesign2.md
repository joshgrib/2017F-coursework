## Constraints

### Cardinality constraint
* **Cardinality ratio** - the ratio of entities from set A that relate to entities in set B
* 4 types
    * one-to-one
        * SSN to license number
    * one-to-many
        * mother to children
    * many-to-one
        * children to parents
    * many-to-many
        * cars to owners
* shown by putting an arrow from one entity to the relationship of one-to-one relations

### Participation constraint
* **Total participation** - every entity in set A must have a relationship to set B
    * Shown by making the line from the entity to the relation **bold**
* **Partial participation** - not all entities need a relation

### Weak entities
* Entities tat exist as a byproduct of another entity's existence, not independantly
    * shown by making the entity, the relation line, and the relationship bold, and also putting an arrow from the entity to the relationship
        * This shows total participation as well as one-to-many
* Identified by using the partial key from the weak entity as well as the primary key from the parent entity
