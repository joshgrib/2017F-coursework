## Steps in DB design
1. Requirements analysis - user needs
2. Conceptual design - high level
3. Logical design - turn ER into DBMS data model
4. Schema refinement - consistency, normalization
5. Physical design - indexes, disk layout
6. Security design - access controls

Steps 1-3: design a database

Step 4: design a good database

Step 5-6: advances

### Conceptual DB design
* Entity-relationship (ER) model shows objects and how they relate
    * Entities are nouns
    * Relationships are statements about 2 or more entities
    * Diagram
        * Entities are in boxes
        * Relatonships are in diamonds
        * Attributes are in circles
        * Attributes and relationships are connected to entities with lines
            * Keys are underlined
* Keys
    * A **superkey** is a set of attributes that uniquely identify an entity
    * A **key** or candidate key is the minimal subset of the superkey to ensure unique identification
        * A key is still a superkey, just the minimal version of it
* Relationships
    * Binary - connects 2 entities
    * Ternary - connects 3 relationships
    * N-ary - connects N relationships
