## CS 442 Homework 2 - Josh Gribbon

### Problem 1
Consider a relational database about hotels, customers (guests) and their bookings that are maintained by an on­line hotel­booking company. The database consists of the following tables (where the primary keys are underlined):
* Hotel (hId, hName, hAddress, hCity)
* Guest(gId, gName, gAddress, gCity)
* Room(hid, roomNo, type, price )
* Booking(gId, hId, roomNo, fromDate, year, noOfDays)

The Booking relation indicates that a guest booked a hotel room for a specified number of days (noOfDays) starting from fromDate of a given year. For instance, a tuple <g12345, h5555, 220, Jan05, 2005, 8> in Booking indicates that guest g12345 booked room 220 of the h5555 hotel for 8 days starting on Jan 5, 2005. The attribute "gAddress" records the home address of the guests.

Write the following queries in relational algebra [5*6pts=30pts]:

#### 1.1 Return the name of guests who have booked a hotel room in NYC in January 2017 (tips: "January 2017' = "Jan01, 2017 to Jan31, 2017".

#### 1.2 Return the name of guests who have booked a hotel room of type “suite” in NYC for longer than 10 days.

#### 1.3 Return the name of guests who never booked a hotel room for longer than 5 days.

#### 1.4 Return the IDs of the hotels located in NYC which were not booked at all in the year 2017.

#### 1.5 Return the ids of the guests who have booked at least one room of type “suite” in every hotel located in NYC.


### Problem 2
Consider the following relational schema
* Emp(eid : integer, ename : string, age : integer, salary : real)
* Works(eid : integer, did : integer)
* Dept(did : integer, budget : real, managerid : integer, dname:string)

Since the mangers are employers, the did value of the managers in Dept table is the same as the eid value of these managers in Emp table.

The key fields are underlined, and the domain of each field is listed after the field name. The Works relation maps employees to the departments. Write the following queries in SQL [5*6pts=30pts].

#### 2.1 Find the name and age of all employees who work in both Hardware and Software departments.

#### 2.2 Find the id of managers who control the largest amount of budget.

#### 2.3 Find the id of the managers who manage only the departments of budget that is at least 1 million dollars.

#### 2.4 Find the name of all employees whose salary exceeds the budget of all the departments that the employee works in.

#### 2.5 Find the name of managers who manage the department of the largest budgets.

### Problem 3
Consider a relational database about real estate that is maintained by a real estate agency. The database consists of the following table (where the primary keys are underlined):
* House (id, asking_price, address, postal_code, baths, beds, sqft, sellerID)
* Seller(id, name, home_phone, e­mail, agentID)
* Buyer(id, name, home_phone, e­mail, agentID)
* Agent(id, name, mobile_phone, e­mail)
* Sold(house_id, buyer_id, sale­date, selling_price)  

The House table gives information about a house for sale. The Seller table gives information about the sellers of a house. The Buyer table gives information about (prospective) home buyers. The Agent table gives information about agents (who can act on behalf of either the buyer or the seller). And the Sold table gives information about the sale of a particular home – including the price at which the home actually sold, which may be different from the asking price.

#### 3.1 Answer the following questions in relational algebra [2*10pts=20pts]:

##### 3.1.a Return the id, addresses, asking_price, and selling_price of all houses that are sold at price  less than the asking price.

##### 3.1.b Return the names of all of (prospective) buyers who have not bought a house.

#### 3.2 Answer the following questions in SQL [2*10pts=20pts]:

##### 3.2.a For each postal code in which there were at least three houses sold, find the postal code and the  average selling price of houses in that postal code.

##### 3.2.b Find the addresses and asking prices of all houses that have at least 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms that have not been sold. Each (address, asking price) pair should appear only once.
